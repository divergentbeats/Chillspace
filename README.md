## 🧘 Chillspace: Secure Mental Wellness Platform

**Project Type:** Collaborative, Full-Stack Application Prototype (React & Firebase)

**[LIVE DEMO 🔗](https://chillsspace.netlify.app/)**

Chillspace is a youth mental wellness platform prototype focused on providing resources for emotional and mental support. This project marked a significant shift in my development stack, moving to a modern, component-based architecture using **React** and integrating real backend services. It highlights skills in secure authentication and team collaboration.

### 🔐 Technical & Security Highlights

* **Modern Frontend:** Built entirely using **React**, showcasing mastery of component-based architecture and state management.
* **Secure Authentication:** Implements a robust **Firebase Authentication** system for secure user sign-up and login, demonstrating knowledge of user session management and security best practices.
* **Persistent Data:** Utilizes **Firebase** as the backend service for data persistence and user profile management.
* **Collaborative Development:** Developed as a team effort, requiring successful integration of different features (e.g., meditation module, backend logic) into a cohesive final product.

### 🌟 Key Features

* **Full Login System:** Functional user sign-up and login utilizing email/password.
* **Mental Wellness Resources:** Features modules for guided meditation and educational content.
* **Modern Aesthetics:** Clean, contemporary visual design suitable for the target audience.

### 🚀 Tech Stack

### 💡 Developer Notes & Future Vision

This project was pivotal in my journey, solidifying my transition into **React** and modern full-stack development. The major learning was the challenge of building and integrating a reliable **authentication system** from scratch.

This architecture is perfectly staged for a Cloud-native expansion: integrating a custom API backend (Node.js/Python) deployed on **Google Cloud Run** would allow for complex, scalable API logic, moving the project from a prototype to a fully managed application.
